# Arch Config

The main OS I'll be using for training in cybersecurity(and for other purposes) is Arch Linux. I choose this distribution because I wanted to learn Linux in-depth
and I believe that the best way to do that is to use a bare-bones distribution, like Arch.

This folder contains config files for various packages I install on the OS. It does NOT contain configs for every package, only a select few.
